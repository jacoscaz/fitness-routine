## 2025-02-12

- Replaced weekly cleans (on tuesday and friday) with swings (on tuesday),
  RDLs and good mornings (on friday), addressing a lack of focus on hip
  hinging. 
- Added the kettlebell floor press to monday's horizontal pressing,
  complementing the push-up by introducing control of unstable, external
  objects in the horizontal plane.

Thanks to Mattia Vitali from the [Garage Gym][2025-02-12-1] in Melzo

## 2025-06-05

- Greater focus on kettlebells for overhead lifts, complementing sandbags.
- Slight tweak to grouping on thursdays (vertical pushing) to enforce the
  bodyweight component (handstand push-ups).

## 2025-04-13

- Further slight increase in specificity by focusing tuesdays on horizontal
  pulling and fridays on vertical pulling.
- Added rows back into the schedule as a weighted horizontal pulling exercise.

## 2025-04-09

- Slightly increased daily specificity by focusing mondays on horizontal
  pressing and thursdays on vertical pressing. This is done so that each
  pressing day focuses on a single movement axis for the upper body,
  hopefully reducing the sense of CNS fatigue that I've noticed over the
  last two weeks.
- Minor language tweaks to clarify how one should choose the number of
  reps and sets per component (upper body, lower body).

## 2025-02-12

- Replaced weekly cleans (on tuesday and friday) with swings (on tuesday),
  RDLs and good mornings (on friday), addressing a lack of focus on hip
  hinging. 
- Added the kettlebell floor press to monday's horizontal pressing,
  complementing the push-up by introducing control of unstable, external
  objects in the horizontal plane.

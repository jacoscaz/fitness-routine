## 2025-04-09

- Slightly increased daily specificity by focusing mondays on horizontal
  pressing and thursdays on vertical pressing. This is done so that each
  pressing day focuses on a single movement axis for the upper body,
  hopefully reducing the sense of CNS fatigue that I've noticed over the
  last two weeks.
- Minor language tweaks to clarify how one should choose the number of
  reps and sets per component (upper body, lower body).

## 2025-02-12

- Replaced weekly cleans (on tuesday and friday) with swings (on tuesday),
  RDLs and good mornings (on friday), addressing a lack of focus on hip
  hinging. 
- Added the kettlebell floor press to monday's horizontal pressing,
  complementing the push-up by introducing control of unstable, external
  objects in the horizontal plane.

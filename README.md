## Intro

This repository tracks the evolution of my fitness routine, which I've been
developing and [dogfooding][i1] for a number of years.

**_I am not a qualified professional and I share this program solely for
informative purposes._** Make sure to read the [license][i2] and [liability][i3]
sections below before continuing and always check in with your medical and
fitness professionals before making changes to your fitness regime.

## The routine

The routine lives as a printer-friendly, evolving [HTML document][r5].

## Goals

> [...] fitness is about performing well at any and every task imaginable.
>
> &mdash; [CrossFit Journal][g1]

1. **Daily**: this routine is designed for people that, like me, have an
   easier time committing to smaller daily efforts rather than greater weekly
   ones.
2. **Generalist**: this routine is designed to develop general fitness levels.
   It does not optimize for strength, power, speed, endurance or hypertrophy
   but aims to strike a _functional_ compromise between each of these that can
   easily transfer to the trainee's daily life.
3. **Sustainable**: this routine is designed to minimize daily volume while
   maximizing weekly variety to lessen its impact on joints, ligaments and 
   allow for shorter recovery times.
4. **Portable**: this routine is designed to be relatively portable, minimizing
   the amount of required equipment and optimizing for equipment easy to carry
   around and/or [DIY][g3].
5. **Safe**: this routine is designed around weight types with greater
   stabilization requirements, limiting the amount of weight that the trainee
   will be able to move. This routine is also designed to minimize the risk of
   injury and/or damage inherent in handling heavy weights, selecting movement
   variations that can be easily aborted.

## Equipment

At minimum, this routine requires the following pieces of equipment:

- **Sandbags**. Specifically, [boulder-style][e4] sandbags, big and small.
  Instead of sand, consider filling with [pea gravel][e5]. Additionally and
  optionally, [log-style][e6] sandbags with handles.
- A **pull-up bar**. Prefer freestanding or wall-mounted/ceiling-mounted bars
  to doorway bars. Preferably high enough to strap rings on it. Alternatively,
  a sturdy branch can suffice. Alternatively, rings can suffice. 
- A **dip station** or any other kind of dipping setup. If nothing else is
  available, a set of high-back chairs can suffice. Alternatively, rings can
  suffice.
- A set of **dumbbells and plates** ([like these][e7]) accompanied by a couple
  of **kettlebell handles** ([like these][e8]).

> Needless to say, most things will break when impacted by a kettlebell
> unintentionally propelled into the air due to grip failure. **Be careful**!

### Rings 

A **set of gymnastic rings** can be an invaluable tool, both as a gateway to
(much) harder movements and variations but also as an incredibly portable,
all-in-one alternative to both the pull-up bar and the dip station. Get good
straps with good buckles! You do not want to fall head-first into the ground
while inverted.

> **Beware of using rings too soon!**.  Particularly when it comes to pushing
> exercises (push-up, dip), rings can lead you to inadvertent poor shoulder
> placement and scapular movement, greatly increasing the risk of injury.
> **Being able to support yourself on rings is not an indicator that you have
> the strength to perform dynamic movements on them.**

### Additional equipment

Other pieces of equipment I highly suggest:

- A **rowing machine**. A very nice and versatile piece of equipment, ideal for
  warming up and slow days in which I do not feel like working out.
- A **jump rope**. Good for warming up and HIIT/metcon workouts.
